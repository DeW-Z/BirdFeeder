Hello!

Welcome to the Bird Feeder assembly manual. In case you made it this far without knowing, Bird Feeder is a DIY bullet feeder for your progressive reloading press. You place bulk bullets in the hopper and Bird Feeder will flip them the correct direction and drop them down to your toolhead.

This is Revision B of this model and while it certainly does have improvements over the first, it is a bit more involved. In addition to the normal wiring and crimping, you need to have a PCB made in China, order a bunch of small components and then when they arrive in 5-6 business weeks, solder them on to the board. Lastly, you then will need to load the firmware and make all the final adjustments. Do not sweat though, we’re going to walk you through it.

If this sounds too involved or like something that you frankly just do not want to mess with, you should know that the original model is just as capable and not inferior in anyway, it just lacks these cool features:

The main benefits to Revision B are:
-	Use of a NEMA 17 Stepper Motor (easily to consistently source the same component).
-	Nearly silent operation with an incredibly wide range of speed adjustment.
-	Built in “slipper clutch” to prevent damage in the event of a jam.
-	Small footprint with no external speed or motor controller. Everything is housed on the unit.
-	Spring loaded nose guide for quick and easy adjustment.
-	A revised mount that better contours to the shape of the Dillon XL Case feeder.
-	Optional hardware free bullet “kicker” to remove bullets that are not fully seated in the collator.

In the PCB folder is a Zip file, which you can upload directly to JLCPCB.com and they will make you five of the boards for only a few dollars.
